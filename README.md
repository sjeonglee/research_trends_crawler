# research_trends_crawler

This program was created to collect titles from articles published in journals in a particular field. (The example is Social Sciences-Geography, Planning and Development field from ELSEVIER).

### About robots.txt
I tried my best to make this program comply with robots.txt. It was allowed from journals.elsevier.com to scrap journal titles, but to crawl journal keywords was not allowed from sciencedirect.com. Please let me know if I missed something with robots.txt or anything.
